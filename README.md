**Patient Readmission Risk Prediction** 

A machine learning project that analyzes 100k+ hospital encounter records to predict the likelihood of patient readmission within 30 days. 

# Patient Readmission Risk Prediction (Healthcare Analytics)
Predicting hospital readmission within 30 days using ML and real-world healthcare data.

**Problem**

Hospital readmissions within 30 days of discharge are a critical challenge in the healthcare industry.
They lead to:

‚ö†Ô∏è Higher healthcare costs for hospitals, patients, and insurance providers
‚ö†Ô∏è Reduced quality of care and patient satisfaction
‚ö†Ô∏è Financial penalties for hospitals under value-based care programs
üëâ The challenge is to identify patients at high risk of being readmitted so that hospitals can provide early interventions (follow-up care, personalized treatment, home visits).

**Goal**

Develop a machine learning model that:
Predicts whether a patient will be readmitted within 30 days of discharge
Identifies key risk factors driving readmissions (age, diagnoses, comorbidities, hospital stay)
Provides actionable insights through dashboards and explainable ML for clinicians and hospital administrators
